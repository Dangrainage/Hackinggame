A 2D hacking game written in Lua for Love2D. Made specifically as a way to kind of patch the unholy voodoo that was my Gunpoint knockoff.

I noticed that with Grainpoint, my code was written In such a way that any form of expansion was made 20 times more complex than It needed to be due to me writing my code very sparatically and messily.
This Is the opposite of that.
I'm avoiding needless lines when the needed data can be placed within a table (look at the player table)
And generally writing the code more cleanly, readably and to be generally more easily expandable.
